# PasswordBox

Use PasswordBox to store your password with encrypt. 
This APP ask for no permission which is to say it can not upload your passwords or save it to SD card. It is saved in the private database with encrypt, so 
no apps could access it even if they get the root privilege. 
Encrypted by AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) which takes billions of years to crack without your key. 
APP will not save the encryption key,The key is your pattern which you draw when you log in, and what verify your pattern is a special text encrypted when you set your pattern, so the encryption key is safe too.
